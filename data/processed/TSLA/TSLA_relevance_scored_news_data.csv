2024-10-02,Tesla's energy division on track to keep pace with autos demand,"Tesla (TSLA) stock is facing downward pressure after falling short of it's highly anticipated third-quarter delivery expectations. The company reported 462,890 deliveries, slightly below the Bloomberg estimate of 463,897. William Blair group head of energy and sustainability research sector Jed Dorsheimer joins Morning Brief to discuss his outlook on the automaker. Dorsheimer notes that the growing optimism in delivery estimates on Wall Street was closely tied to Tesla's rising stock price. Consequently, he says, ""it's not surprising to see a pullback"" now that the numbers have missed expectations. Despite this setback, Dorsheimer points out that this quarter demonstrates Tesla's stabilization ahead of ""some key catalysts"" for the business, including the upcoming robotaxi event and the Shanghai energy business. Importantly, Dorsheimer emphasizes the significance of Tesla's energy business and its potential impact on the company's future growth. He states, ""Our grids are stressed to the max right now and that's a global statement.

2024-10-02,Why the Nasdaq is positioned for long-term growth,"Technical indicators from Oppenheimer suggest that big tech companies, especially names like Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), are poised to outperform in the coming months. Oppenheimer Head of Technical Analysis Ari Wald joins Catalysts to discuss this outlook. Wald emphasizes that the key positive for markets is that market breadth ""remains firm,"" supporting higher highs throughout the end of 2024. Based on this, he believes ""the bull cycle is intact,"" with the market positioned for continued growth into 2025. He advises buying higher growth companies, explaining, ""The scarcity premium comes back against a lower growth backdrop for these names,"" especially within the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC). Wald elaborates on the Nasdaq's potential: ""It has underperformed since the summer, but I think through this rotational nature it is set up to lead again. It did a good job holding up support levels and so for that reason, for us, it's growth for the long-term. I think this is a growth and tech-led secular bull, and then on a near-term basis, it's become tactically attractive to buy that style as well.""

Traders flocked to more defensive areas of the market in Tuesday's trading session after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel. Israel has vowed to respond to the attack, raising concerns about tensions in the Middle East escalating even further. Raymond James Washington policy analyst and managing director Ed Mills observes that markets have been ""shockingly resilient"" despite global unrest. ""There are a lot of unknowns ahead and Israel will absolutely respond. They cannot let hundreds of missiles going towards their country be met without a response,"" Mills states. However, he notes that the nature of Israel's response remains ""uncertain."" US private payroll numbers beat Wall Street expectations in September, according to the latest ADP report. The data shows that 143,000 jobs were added in the private sector last month, surpassing the projected 125,000 jobs — a significant increase from August's reported 99,000 jobs. Tesla (TSLA) shares are under pressure after the company reported that it delivered 462,890 vehicles during the third quarter. This figure came in slightly below Wall Street's expectation of 463,897 deliveries. William Blair group head of energy and sustainability research sector, Jed Dorsheimer, notes that the growing optimism in delivery estimates on Wall Street was closely tied to Tesla's rising stock price.

Nike (NKE) is looking for a fresh start under its incoming CEO, Elliott Hill. The footwear giant reported mixed fiscal first quarter results, withdrew its full-year sales guidance, and postponed its investor day that was originally scheduled for November. Hill will step into the role on October 14, where he will embark on a turnaround mission for the company. Baird Senior Research Analyst Jonathan Komp argues that under Hill, Nike will likely be able to improve its performance, saying, ""Generally, we expect stocks in the sector to bottom when earnings start getting less bad. We think we've seen the worst here for Nike, but it is going to take patience."" As the Federal Reserve's rate easing cycle is underway, Megan Horneman, Verdence Capital Advisors CIO, believes that investors are putting too much faith in a soft landing. She tells Yahoo Finance, ""People are just getting a little ahead of themselves as far as what strength there is in the economy."" While the labor market remains ""relatively strong,"" she has concerns about the consumer, noting that credit card debt is over $1 trillion. She adds, ""We know that inflation is coming down towards the Fed's target, but we can't forget that this has been accumulating for several years now. So this is really a strain on consumers...

2024-10-02,Tesla's Q3 deliveries don't matter in big picture: Analyst,"Tesla’s third quarter deliveries came in below Wall Street’s expectations, only adding to the mounting pressures facing the auto industry. Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets lead equity analyst of global autos, sits down with Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to dig into Tesla's (TSLA) delivery numbers and where the company stands going forward. Narayan outlines his view that Tesla’s subpar auto sales don’t actually matter, explaining that the “car business for me is less, like 5% of my [Tesla] valuation. They need to sell cars to sell [full self-driving] FSD and everything else. But I think folks are going to start looking at the bottom line more on gross profit. You're going to have regulatory credits, which surprised a lot of people last quarter. It's going to be good this quarter again and next year. And energy storage, people are finally talking about this. We saw the number that they printed today wasn't as good as last quarter, but way bigger than the run rate of last year. So I think folks are going to stop looking at the delivery numbers so carefully. And start looking at gross profit. And it's going to look pretty good.” He says the highly-anticipated robotaxi is “half of my entire valuation, as you know. I'm a big believer in the robotaxi concept. The difference, though, between this event and what they held in the Power Day a few years ago, where the stock was up quite a bit, is Power Day was more real now, whereas I think robotaxis are a little bit farther away. That's why I think it might be difficult to get crazy excited, at least a stock to react the way it will be. I think it did into it, but I do think you'll get a lot of people like me writing big reports finally with real numbers and putting it in their models. That might help. But again, this is far into the future, so I just don't know how much it's going to impact.” The long horizon for Tesla’s robotaxi isn’t a tech issue but rather a regulatory issue. “We all saw what happened with GM Cruise having to pull away and now starting to tip their toe back in. Cities are going to have to completely re-engineer themselves… It's a very human-driven thing, let's put it that way. You're making decisions all the time. And so it's going to take a while for regulators to be okay with that.” The analyst offers his perspective on the Cybertruck and the model's role in the Tesla brand. “I don't think it's a real game-changer. If anything, they're losing money on it, but it is trying to get excitement back into the brand, which maybe they lost a little compared to where they were. But really, ultimately, this is a halo car that hopefully lifts their brand.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

2024-10-04,Cathie Wood talks OpenAI investment and Tesla's robotaxi,"OpenAI recently raised $6.6 billion in a new funding round, giving it a valuation of about $157 billion. One firm that has been investing in OpenAI is Ark Invest. Cathie Wood, ARK Invest's CEO and CIO, is betting big on AI. She says OpenAI, along with Anthropic, xAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (META) are ""stealing the march"" in the space.  While many investors are concerned about when companies will start seeing returns on their AI investments, Wood is hopeful. When asked about when OpenAI will start to turn a profit, she points to the development of agentic AI, which she thinks will open the door to more profitability, given that companies will be able to charge more for it. Despite some recent executive departures at OpenAI, Wood is confident in the startup's leadership, praising both CEO Sam Altman and CFO Sarah Friar. She notes that ""what we witness in companies that are growing very quickly from startup into scaling is you need a different kind of management team."" When it comes to competition between AI firms, Wood likes it. ""Competition is good. It's going to make this space more competitive and more effective, I think, longer term,"" she says. On the possibility of a company like OpenAI going public, Wood argues ""a lot of companies are staying private longer. They just don't want to deal with the regulation in the public equity markets. And they also don't want to deal with the very short-term oriented or short-term investment time horizon of shareholders in the public equity markets."" However, she does think the public market could become more appealing with interest rates coming down and if investors were willing to stomach the longer-term time horizons some of these companies are working with.

2024-10-05,"Tesla, Google, Amazon: Inside the robotaxi market","The launch of Tesla’s (TSLA) robotaxi marks one of the most consequential in the company’s history - if only, because Elon Musk has hailed this as the future for nearly a decade. For eight years, Musk has teased the vision of a shared fleet of fully-autonomous Teslas, with the promise of that technology contributing significantly to the company’s valuation. The long-anticipated launch comes amid increased scrutiny about the promise of self-driving technology. While Google’s Waymo has logged more than 22 million rider miles with few incidents in select cities, accidents involving GM’s Cruise and Tesla’s autopilot technology have raised questions about the technology’s ability to scale safely. Amazon’s Zoox is providing a potential template for the future, building vehicles for the sole purpose of ferrying passengers autonomously, without the traditional controls like a steering wheel and pedals. The company says that their new technology will ensure cost efficiency and safety. Founder Jesse Levinson said that Zoox’s robotaxi is fundamentally different from Tesla’s driver assistance system, as Tesla vehicles require drivers to be ready to take control at any moment.  While Zoox doesn’t rely on human drivers for assistance, the company does use remote operators to guide the vehicle in rare situations.  “The vehicles are only getting help from humans only 1% of the time,” Levinson said. “As it gets more sophisticated, the amount of time they’re asking for help goes down.”  Still, critics question the economics and safety of self-driving taxis, noting that current autonomous rides are more expensive than car ownership, despite being cheaper than traditional rides. While Tesla investors are optimistic about robotaxis, experts believe substantial revenue is still years away.",Yahoo,0.0553,"['Tesla', 'Google', 'Amazon', 'Tesla', 'TSLA', 'Google', 'GM', 'Tesla', 'Amazon', 'Zoox', 'Zoox', 'Tesla', 'Tesla', 'Zoox', 'Tesla']"

The stock is a top holding in the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK), which is down about 11% so far in 2024. Ark Invest CEO and CIO Cathie Wood says of the upcoming event, ""Tesla is giving us great comfort, believe it or not, because we've done the research. I don't think a lot of analysts have done the kind of research on autonomous mobility that we have. We have a longer investment time horizon. That's why we've done the research."" Wood thinks analysts will have to upwardly revise their estimates for what a robotaxi means for Tesla's bottom line, stating that she sees it as ""a software as a service model with 80% gross margins plus on that side of the model, as opposed to 15 to 30% margins on the EV side."" In the interview with Yahoo Finance, Wood explains why she is bullish on Tesla's robotaxi: ""This is not if, it is when for Tesla. And for Tesla, it's also how quickly will they roll out?

2024-10-07,"Mass-market car needed to jump-start EV demand: Lucid, Tesla","Lucid (LCID) stock gains after the electric vehicle (EV) maker reported an increase in deliveries. Ronald Jewsikow, Guggenheim Securities director of automotive equity research, joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to discuss what’s next for Lucid and EV demand. “I think Lucid has some catalysts on the horizon in terms of the gravity launch, which does unlock some [Total Addressable Market] TAM, but we've seen that the high-end electric SUV market is not as big as I think investors would have expected a few years ago. We've seen Rivian (RIVN) sales kind of stall out here, as well as Tesla's (TSLA) Model S and X sales,” Jewsikow tells Yahoo Finance. He says, “I think that until we get to the mass-market car, which for Lucid is 2026 and beyond, it's kind of there is a lack of catalyst to really drive growth and see that step function change, improvement in unit economics and profitability, which is tough for investors to underwrite.” “We've seen the same pressure on Rivian, which we're berated on just that this view that until 2026, there's no real catalyst to change EV demand if you don't have a mass-market product,” Jewsikow adds.

2024-10-07,5 things investors can expect from Tesla's robotaxi event,"Tesla's (TSLA) highly anticipated robotaxi event is on Thursday, and Barron's associate editor Al Root joins Asking for a Trend to break down what investors can expect from CEO Elon Musk. Root points to five things investors are expecting from the robotaxi event. First, there will be a physical unveiling of the robotaxi. Second, investors want to hear about safety data. Next, Tesla will likely touch on its business model, discussing everything from licensing to the size of its robotaxi fleet. The fourth point investors will be looking for is a launch date. Finally, Tesla could announce something extra. Root explains, ""A lot of people think we'll see the lower price so-called Model 2 that's due in early 2025, maybe that will make an appearance. And maybe an update about the robot called Optimist."" Root also compares Tesla and Waymo's self-driving vehicles. While Waymo has built driverless vehicles and took a modest approach to its rollout, Root notes that Tesla is instead focused on improving its driver-assistance software to turn vehicles into self-driving cars. ""Now, Tesla argues, 'We've got millions of cars giving us data. We have billions of miles driven with full self-drive on.' Yet, they've never done a single official autonomous cab ride. Waymo has,"" Root tells Yahoo Finance. He continues, ""So it's sort of like, you tell me, which approach do you like better? One feels a little safer. One feels a little more Musk-ian.

Stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) closed lower on Monday, retreating from Friday's gains that were fueled by September's better-than-expected jobs figures. Yahoo Finance senior markets reporter Josh Schafer analyzes the day's key market trends, focusing on the rise in 10-year Treasury yields (^TNX) and the noticeable slowdown in interest rate-sensitive stocks. The US dockworkers port strikes have temporarily paused, allowing for continued negotiations. University of Richmond's Robins School of Business professor Shital Thekdi notes that the core of the port strike dialogue centers on ""efficiencies and the use of automation in ways that can replace workers."" However, she emphasizes that other critical considerations are at play, including extreme events, ""atypical working conditions,"" and ""generally unsafe working conditions."" ""The potential is that AI and technology can actually help improve health and safety of workers, which is incredibly important,"" Thekdi tells Yahoo Finance.

To discuss why Tesla's stock is declining following this reveal, Hamilton Capital Partners chief investment officer Alonso Munoz joins Catalysts. Munoz describes the event as ""futuristic"" and ""fun to watch."" However, he believes analysts will need to wait for the company's earnings call to fully understand Musk's strategy, which could serve as a catalyst for the stock. While some specifics remain unclear, Munoz considers the dip in the stock price ""an overreaction."" As Tesla has shifted focus from creating a lower-cost vehicle to emphasizing autonomous driving and other ventures, investors are questioning whether this is the best strategy for the automaker. Munoz comments, ""In the macro environment we're in, we saw consumer confidence come in a little bit lower this morning, and interest rates are still high. So affordability is a big question analysts are mulling over. When we look at vehicles, it's a major purchase for consumers. Whether it's their house or their vehicle, it's one of their highest costs. I think it would be smart for Tesla to roll out a lower entry-level vehicle at a lower price point.""

It's exciting because anytime you have a disrupter of that type that is going to go in and potentially disrupt a business model that exists already, there's a lot of uncertainty about that type of event,"" Kaminski tells Yahoo Finance. She notes that there was a sell-off in Tesla's stock after the event, while names like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) were up. She explains, ""What I would think that means is that this is an exciting idea. We need to watch it. But we also have a lot of things have to be figured out for this to come to fruition. So I think it's really a trade you'll have to watch and actually see ... how can they navigate the regulation front, how can they handle some of those issues that disrupting this industry would require."" While the EV market has been under pressure, Kaminski highlights that inflation has been weighing on consumers, and many have put their plans to purchase cars on hold. She argues that Tesla's robotaxis could benefit from this environment, saying, ""If vehicles continue to be more expensive, people are going to have to find alternatives.

CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson joins Morning Brief to discuss how the event is weighing on Tesla's stock and whether CEO Elon Musk can deliver value to shareholders. Nelson believes that the decline in Tesla's stock could be the beginning of a larger pullback. ""If you look at where it's trading on consensus estimates, the stock where it closed yesterday is trading at 75 times consensus estimates for next year. Looking out to 2026, it's trading at 57 times. So these are really pretty lofty multiples. And here we're left with a lot of questions regarding how it's going to achieve that earnings growth that is embedded in expectations over the next few years,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. He adds, ""This is a high-growth stock whose growth has hit a wall here recently."" Nelson points out that Elon Musk has a history of not meeting previously communicated timelines: ""If you look back a decade ago, he was promising fully autonomous vehicles only a year or two away. Here we are in 2024, and it's still that. We think Tesla is still a ways away from that."" Thus, he believes that the investors' expectations are ""too high,"" especially given a general slowing of EV sales. With such a lack of clarity around Tesla's product pipeline, Nelson argues that auto names like General Motors (GM) and Uber (UBER) are among the best positioned to win when Tesla loses.

He explains that the main investor question has been: If Tesla emerges as the preferred rideshare option, what happens to Uber and Lyft? This concern has grown ""louder and louder over the last 3-6 months."" However, based on the outcome of Thursday's robotaxi event, Kulkarni says it was ""a big, big relief"" for these companies because the event demonstrated that ""creating a scalable robotaxi business is not easy.""

2024-10-11,It's going to be 'very tough' for Lyft to catch Uber. Here's why.,"On today's installment of Good Buy or Goodbye, host Julie Hyman is joined by BD8 Capital Partners, LLC, CEO and CIO Barbara Doran to discuss her investment outlook in the rideshare space.  Doran recommends Uber (UBER) as a stock to buy, emphasizing its dominant market position and diversified business model. She notes, ""they are just growing their share,"" currently at 76%, with its closest competitor, Lyft (LYFT), at just 23% of the rideshare market. Furthermore, Doran points out that Tesla's (TSLA) Cybercab unveil at its Robotaxi Day event suggests competition for autonomous driving isn't an imminent threat, as it will be ""hard for them to catch up."" She also highlights Uber's strong financial position, citing profitability, free cash flow of $1.7 billion, and a $7 billion share buyback authorization. The primary risk she identifies is a potential slowdown in consumer spending. On the other hand, Doran advises avoiding Lyft stock. She notes the company's lower profitability and significantly smaller scale compared to Uber, stating it's ""going to be very tough"" for Lyft to achieve Uber's current market status. Additionally, she points out Lyft's high debt-to-equity ratio, resulting in a weak balance sheet. Lyft stock also consistently underperforms its main competitor, Uber. However, Doran acknowledges one positive aspect: Lyft's new management team, which could drive continued improvement.

2024-10-14,Tesla automation will be a stablecoin catalyst: Anthony Pompliano,"Tesla's (TSLA) latest creations — a driverless Cybercab, Robovan, and even its Optimus humanoid robots — could be making the case for wider spread stablecoin usage, according to Anthony Pompliano's latest Substack article. Tesla CEO Elon Musk introduced these new products at the EV maker's Robotaxi Day event last Thursday. Pompliano, the founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith to explain why this is the next step in the ""age of automation"" which could ""usher in a new era for money,"" which is where the stablecoin comes in. Pompliano likens the use of autonomous vehicles and robots to the conception of E-Z Pass for cars, which a stablecoin will allow for easier transactions on the owner's behalf. ""Now, a lot of people in the past have pointed to bitcoin (BTC-USD) being one of those potential currencies. But I don't think that people or machines are going to want to spend their bitcoin,"" Pompliano tells Yahoo Finance. ""If Bitcoin is going to be more valuable in the future, they're going to want to save that. It's like a savings account. Instead, they're going to want to use their checking account, which is digital stablecoins."" Furthering this sentiment, Pompliano continues to be bullish on both automation and crypto, labeling the integration of the two as a ""multi-decade trend."" ""When you have these kinds of secular tailwinds and these technologies are obviously going to become more adopted, there will be companies within each sector that don't work,"" Pompliano says. ""You can actually buy, be right on the sector and wrong on the company. And so you need to be careful about which individual companies or individual cryptocurrencies that you're actually putting that capital towards."" He goes on to comment on how central banks seem to be listening and responding to calls for stablecoin adoption.

Kaufman points out that the Magnificent Seven trade continues to drive strong market returns, with the group up 40% this year. He notes, ""The Mag Seven is still accounting for a significant portion"" of market gains, even as the other 493 S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies are starting to gain momentum. ""If the leadership in the Mag 7 stops continuing going forward, maybe the innovation doesn't keep up at the same pace, then you would want exposure to those other names as well,"" Kaufman advises. He suggests investors consider CANQ (CANQ), an ETF that provides exposure to top names using options to remain defensive.

Market Domination welcomes the analyst behind the call, RBC Capital Markets analyst Chris Dendrinos, to speak more about the solar energy landscape.

It's the Powerwall 3, and that has an inverter and a battery included with it,"" Dendrinos tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton. ""And then on the market adoption side, we're seeing a transition away from where a homeowner is going to outright own the solar system, and instead they're going to lease it through a company, or they're going to do what's called a power purchase agreement, a PPA.

I mean, Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world.""

Bipartisan Policy Center executive director of economic policy Shai Akabas and The Washington Note founding editor-at-large Steve Clemons provide insights into the potential makeup of Trump's incoming administration on Wealth! Clemons notes that multiple individuals are being considered for key Cabinet positions, including names like Mike Pompeo, Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton, and Josh Hawley. However, Clemons does not foresee Elon Musk being appointed to a formal Cabinet role despite being a major influence throughout Trump's campaign period. ""I think Elon is in a complicated position. For him to get a Senate-confirmed position, I think he'd have to pretty much divest himself from a lot of his assets that define him, like SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA)."" Instead, Clemons believes Musk may be offered an advisory role. One of the initiatives Musk has reportedly advocated for is cutting federal spending by up to $2 trillion. Akabas calls this an ""admirable goal,"" but notes the challenge lies in the fact that much of the government's spending is on ""autopilot"" through programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the national debt. Akabas explains that the potential areas for cuts represent only around 15% of the overall federal budget.

Liquidity events, very importantly, involve mergers and acquisitions, and those ground to a halt, even in mergers or deals where the two companies were not competing with each other,"" Wood tells Yahoo Finance. A long-time supporter of Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Wood believes he will play a ""vitally important role"" in Trump's government efficiency initiative while remaining ""focused"" on the plethora of companies he owns. ""As he says, and I've always believed, government spending is taxation, and we are bloated right now. We're just overwhelmed with taxation as well,"" Wood explains. ""So I think that he's going to be really important in two ways — introducing new technologies, and actually cutting out a lot of middlemen in the government, just like he did at Twitter."" Tesla currently makes up 14.21% of the ARK Innovation ETF, the holdings worth just over $900 million. Wood is forecasting Tesla stock to reach $2,600 in five years time; while confident in the EV maker's ability to bring safe fully autonomous vehicles to market, she disagrees that Tesla's most recent stock jump has to do with Musk's affiliation with Trump.

Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they ""stand to gain"" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts.

2024-11-18,Is there a future for EV tax credits in a second Trump term?,"With President-elect Donald Trump taking office for his second term, a major conversation circulating this week is whether or not the commander in chief will end tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs). Will his relationship with Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk help influence his decision over these tax credits? Will the two clash over their environmental ideologies? We get into it. In this week’s episode of Capitol Gains, anchor Rachelle Akuffo, Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul, and senior columnist Rick Newman break down everything you need to know about the history of these EV credits and whether or not they could still have a future under the Trump administration. Werschkul says it’s ""a real interesting question"" and the Trump/Musk relationship could factor into the future of these credits. “I think there is a real case to be made that Tesla (TSLA) is fine with a fossil fuel-focused agenda including a rollback of some of the green energy credits,” Werschkul says. “Tesla is an established EV company. If the startups around him get their government funding cut off they’re in a lot of trouble. Tesla is fine. Tesla’s a company. Tesla’s not going anywhere.” Newman breaks down the history of the EV tax credits and how they started during the Obama administration. “There’s a large degree of irony here,” Newman says. “Those consumer credits really persuaded a lot of early adopters to buy a Tesla. And I think there’s a lot of people early on who bought a Tesla who would not have bought it, if not for the tax credit. So that helped Tesla become the leading electric vehicle company, and now [Tesla doesn’t] need it.” To learn more, listen to the full episode of Capitol Gains here.

With all due respect to JPMorgan (JPM) and Netflix (NFLX), the most important earnings report of the early earnings season will come on Tuesday by way of embattled Tesla (TSLA). The EV maker’s stock has been run over since President Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration day, plunging 43%. It’s not hard to find reasons for the tanking. The public’s rebuke of DOGE master and Trump supporter Elon Musk has translated into falling sales. Meanwhile, Trump’s 145% tariffs on China risk Tesla getting the parts it needs to profitably grow a business like the Cybercab while also operating successfully in the country. “The turnaround vision must start this Tuesday night on the earnings conference call for Musk and Tesla,” tech analyst Dan Ives says. Here are three things that Musk must do on the earnings call to begin rebuilding investors' sentiment in the stock:  Government exit timeline: Musk must tell investors when he plans to exit his DOGE role and get back to 100% focus on Tesla. Tariff impact: Musk (or other execs on the earnings call) must clearly quantify the financial impact of Trump’s tariffs on Tesla’s business. Turning Tesla around: Musk must articulate the turnaround plan for Tesla. Whether he likes it not, Tesla is now a turnaround story in the eyes of investors. The company may not be bloated cost-wise like typical turnarounds, but Musk has a lot to fix to get the top line back on track.

2025-04-28,Trump’s first 100 days: How Elon Musk’s Tesla has surprised,"You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. Tesla’s (TSLA) stock is back to its electrified trading sessions following the company’s latest earnings report a week ago. Shares have rallied 18% in the past five trading sessions as Trump supporter and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised to cut back his DOGE-related activities. While the bulls may feel emboldened again on the controversial stock, the reality is shares have done the complete opposite of what many thought at the start of the Trump 2.0 presidency. With Musk literally inside the White House almost daily, it was supposed to mean great things for Tesla’s money-printing presses and stock price. That has hardly been the case. Shares look poised to end Trump’s first 100-day period down more than 30%. First quarter results showed sales and profits plunged as Musk faced public backlash over his DOGE role and dealt with an aging product lineup. The Street remains level-headed with its analysis of the new “show me” stock in Tesla. “We believe downside risk to consensus estimates over the near to medium term is offset by what we think will be improved longer-term profits driven in part by increased software revenue with full self-driving (although we have a more balanced view of Tesla’s monetization potential from FSD than the company is targeting),” Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said. The verdict is out on where Tesla’s stock will be on Trump’s 200-day mark, but for Musk’s sake, hopefully it won’t mirror the performance out of the gate. The path to renewed sales and profit growth won’t be easy, however. The Tesla brand will likely continue to feel blowback from Musk’s outspokenness on government policies. At the same time, tariff policy stands to hammer margins, given Tesla’s exposure to solar panels from China and autos being made outside the US. The uncertainty on how quickly Musk can fix Tesla is something execs pointed to on the earnings release – Tesla yanked its 2025 financial guidance, promising to revisit it when second quarter results hit.

2025-06-09,Musk's feud with Trump reveals one ugly truth about Tesla stock,"You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. The very public spat that has erupted between Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and president Donald Trump has sent shares of the EV maker on a wild, wild ride. Shares are off by 15% over the last five sessions as investors fear Trump will take aim at Musk’s various lines of business. Musk also being out of Trump’s inner circle also runs counter to the bull thesis that circled Tesla’s stock post election. But the dustup between the two powerbrokers brings to light a major problem for Tesla’s stock as Musk tries to jumpstart a sagging EV business. There is a big disconnect between Tesla’s valuation and what’s happening underneath the surface. For example, Tesla’s stock is up 12% since October 2022 – yet, consensus EPS estimates for 2025, 2026 and 2027 have plunged 77%, 70% and 71% since then according to new research from JP Morgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman. Further, the stock is valued at a significant premium to the broader market despite Trump likely doing away with EV tax credits soon. The tax credit has been a driver of Tesla’s sales and profits. EV subsidies represent about 52% of Tesla’s current profits, Brinkman estimates. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.
