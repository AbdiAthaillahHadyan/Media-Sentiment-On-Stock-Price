2024-10-03,"Jobless claims data, market volatility, China stocks: Morning Brief","On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze the market and report on some of the biggest stories of the trading day. All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened lower on Thursday amid the latest labor market data and increasing Middle East tensions. Initial jobless claims for the week ending September 28 rose to 225,000, slightly above the estimated 221,000. Oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) are continuing to spike as tensions boil between Israel and Iran. US stock markets are experiencing a period of heightened volatility, driven by a variety of factors including Hurricane Helene, the upcoming US presidential election, and escalating Middle East tensions. The Wealth Consulting Group's chief market strategist Talley Léger acknowledges that markets have been hit by numerous events that could potentially unsettle investors, questioning, ""when are they perfectly certain?"" However, he notes that such turbulence is a common occurrence in financial markets, adding that ""through it all, the stock market has continued its inexorable march forward."" Due to this dynamic, Léger advises investors to view market dips as potential buying opportunities. The rotation out of Big Tech has become evident, with the standout ""Magnificent Seven"" (AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, GOOGL, AMZN, META, MSFT, NVDA) names no longer being the market frontrunners they once were. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza notes that the Magnificent Seven's market leadership ""hit an abrupt stop"" in mid-July, fueled by the unwinding of the yen carry trade. While Meta has been the only name to somewhat recover, Mazza believes ""it's too early to give up"" on the Magnificent Seven. Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt’s senior research analyst, outlines his bullish stance on Meta. “The growth supports the multiple… The bigger backdrop, we think, is that people are getting more comfortable with Meta’s strategic positioning. Their investments in AI have yielded improved returns on investment for marketers and better engagement from users, and they've kind of led and developed this direct marketing to kind of small- or mid-sized companies globally. This almost new niche that they've pioneered and owned.” Crockett explains. The Hang Seng (^HSI) ended the day lower after 13 straight days of gains following a wave of stimulus measures aimed at bolstering the country's struggling economy. While JPMorgan has warned investors about the risks of chasing the rally given its high valuations, KraneShares CIO Brendan Ahern argues it's still in the ""very, very early innings."" With more information about fiscal policy expected from Chinese officials, the rally could continue. He adds, ""Instead of looking through the rearview mirror, let's look through the windshield.""

2024-10-03,How Helene damage in one town could disrupt the chip sector,"Hurricane Helene may have an unexpected impact on the chip sector. A small town in North Carolina called Spruce Pines produces a significant portion of the quartz needed to make semiconductors. The storm devastated the town and halted mining operations. Peter Hanbury, Bain & Company partner, and leader of operations for technology practice, joins Josh Schafer and Madison Mills on Market Domination Overtime to discuss the potential impact on chipmakers. “The situation in North Carolina has the potential to have a big impact on the industry if it lasts for more than six months… The high-purity quartz produced is really critical to the industry in two ways. It helps produce the silicon wafers that form the basis of all semiconductor products, and it's also used in the wafer manufacturing tools used by TSMC (TSM), Intel (INTC), and Micron (MU).” Supply bottlenecks are “one of the challenges of the industry” since there are limited options for chipmakers to find the resources needed to produce the tech. Hanbury says, “The best players in the industry recognize these bottlenecks and spend a lot of time identifying where these bottlenecks are, developing proactive mitigation plans like additional inventory and monitoring their supply base.” Hanbury reports, “We see several months of inventory along the value chain, which will limit the immediate impact… We don't know the exact impact of the damage or how long it will take to get the facilities up and going again, but we think there's at least a couple of months of inventory to limit the immediate impact.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

2024-10-07,This is Goldman Sachs' stock picking strategy for 'conviction list',"Goldman Sachs (GS) has released its conviction list focusing on three key areas: artificial intelligence, consumer trends, and sustainability. Goldman Sachs Director of Americas Equity Research Steve Kron joins Catalysts to discuss the details. Kron explains that the purpose of this list is to help investors identify stocks where Goldman Sachs has ""the highest level of conviction"" for outperformance. Since the list's introduction last June, Kron emphasizes that ""the feedback has been fantastic."" Pinterest (PINS) was recently added to the list, while Amazon (AMZN) and Guidewire (GWRE) were removed. According to Kron, Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan believes Pinterest has the ability to ""monetize their user base,"" with margin expansion potential over the next five years and earnings projected to be 6% above estimates in 2025. The stock also presents a favorable 3-to-1 upside-to-downside risk ratio. As for Amazon and Guidewire, they were removed to ""keep the list fresh,"" though Kron notes they remain solid stock picks. Regarding the selection process, Kron tells Yahoo Finance, ""We spend a lot of time on investment process, and we spend a lot of time with our analysts talking about stock recommendations. So these are sourced from them,"" with names like Nvidia (NVDA) and Citigroup (C) both making the list. Watch the video above to hear Kron's explanation on how the firm determines the themes of the list.

Host Brad Smith to break down his earnings season dos and don'ts as well as take a look at his artificial intelligence (AI) picks, including Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Walmart (WMT), during third quarter results. “Jumping in front of earnings, that's a no-no,” Mahoney says, adding, “That's like Russian roulette again.” He outlines, “What we like to do in our kind of playbook, as you said, is actually find those companies that beat estimates, raise guidance, and then the analysts trip over themselves.” Conversely, “stay away from the other ones,” Mahoney says, explaining that when a company reports an earnings miss and the stock takes a nosedive, “It looks cheap, [but] I'm telling your viewers that's quicksand. You’d rather go with those companies that beat and raise guidance, even if you have to pay up for it.” Mahoney says he's looking for companies he wants to buy again. “They're going to appear to be kind of expensive. They may take out the year high, but behind it is momentum. Behind it is still those analysts [who] are still playing catch up. So, to us, it separates the men from the boys, so to speak. We'll see that this earnings season as we'll see every other earnings season.” As far as specific names, Mahoney says, “We like technology because they're more consistent.” With consideration to his earnings framework and the ongoing AI trade, he says “We love Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple. All those names kind of and most of those names are going to beat raise guidance probably buy back stock” as well as “companies like Walmart who are actually using [AI] data” to boost productivity.

Bernstein managing director and senior analyst Stacy Rasgon sits down with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton for a conversation around the deepening race between AI chip makers and hyperscalers. ""The gap in terms of timing between what Nvidia is delivering, what AMD is delivering is still very, very wide. I think it's still Nvidia's game to lose,"" Rasgon says. ""People are foreseeing demand continuing, and they're actually making investments to enable that. And with with all these stocks, like there's a big worry that just the numbers have gotten so big so quickly. They're just worried about sustainability. ""But, clearly everything we're seeing from the supply chain and the customers, it doesn't suggest that there's any sort of faltering of demand anytime soon.""

2024-10-17,Why TSMC is a 'bellwether' for the AI trade,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) leads chip stocks higher after reporting better-than-expected third quarter results and raising its 2025 sales forecast. The earnings beat seemed to reassure investors' confidence in artificial intelligence (AI) after ASML Holding (ASML) trimmed its guidance, sending semiconductor stocks lower. TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to discuss his view that TSMC’s earnings beat is more indicative of the AI chip market than ASML’s weakness. O’Donnell tells Yahoo Finance that ASML’s outlook cut “increasingly is going to look like this unusual blip for the semiconductor industry in general.” He explains that issues in the China region and challenges with Intel (INTC) and Samsung (005930.KS) contributed to ASML trimming its guidance, emphasizing that “it's not an overall industry thing.” “TSMC is [a] much better bellwether of where things are going,” the analyst says. “Bottom line, we saw not only the huge beat and then the raise [but also] the discussion even into next year,” indicating demand strength that is expected to continue being strong. “Clearly, I think the people are having a hard time accepting it, but look, this AI thing is real. The demand is real. It's continuing. And there's a lot of opportunity moving forward.” He adds, ""TSMC is just extraordinarily well-positioned, and that's why there's so much focus on them because what happens there really drives the vast majority, especially, of the high-end semiconductor market that we're seeing for AI.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.

Goldman Sachs managing director Toshiya Hari joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss what to expect from the key artificial intelligence (AI) player. The analyst highlights two things that he’s keeping in mind heading into the earnings results: the demand environment around Nvidia’s products and Nvidia’s strength beyond AI training in inferencing that support the chipmaker's growth is strong and sustainable. “First, in terms of the demand profile out there, the environment continues to be very robust. If there is a problem, it's a supply problem, not a demand problem.” Hari notes that while hyperscalers like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) have been Nvidia’s biggest AI customers as they build out AI infrastructure, “the customer profile is broadening beyond the hyperscalers into enterprises and also sovereign states. So there is demand across the board there.” “Secondly, I think there's been this perception historically that Nvidia is very strong in training, yet their competitive position could potentially dilute as we transition to inference… [However] Nvidia's growth opportunity set and potentially expand the competitive moat that they have."" The analyst says that Nvidia's ability ""to really innovate across multiple components” at ""a 12- [to] 18-month cadence” has set it apart from others in the AI space and secured its dominant position. “I think it's going to be very difficult, very challenging, and expensive for others to compete head-to-head with Nvidia.” While the market seems bullish on Nvidia in the near future, Hari says “the big question mark” is the outlook for the 2026 calendar year as investors try to gauge if hyperscalers will continue to spend billions on Nvidia’s chips. Despite Nvidia recently setting a fresh record high, Hari is among analysts who think the stock has more to run. “We do expect upside from here” ahead of Nvidia's report as hyperscalers announce earnings that could send the stock higher.

BMO Wealth Management CIO Yung-Yu Ma joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to check in on the top stories moving the market, including third quarter earnings, the US election, and the Federal Reserve meeting. ""The reaction is really keying off of is just the very high amount of spending that's going into AI and the very uncertain payoffs and far-out potential payoffs that would be coming from those from the mega-cap tech companies that have such a large weighting in the index ... It makes sense that the market isn't going to get enthusiastic about that,"" Ma tells the Morning Brief team. He notes, ""We do think 2025 is going to be a healthy year for earnings growth.

Bokeh Capital Partners founder and CIO Kimberly Forrest joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss what to expect from potential changes in the CHIPS Act. Forrest tells Yahoo Finance she doesn't expect the CHIPS Act to end under President Joe Biden's successor, but there will likely be changes. ""I don't think it's going to end, but I do think the rules are probably going to be revised. I think the current administration put a lot of provisions in that may be slowing down the actual building of chip plants and chips. So I think if either one of them wins, they're going to have to look at that and see how quickly they want the CHIPS Act to actually affect the chips being produced in America."" She adds, ""I'm somebody that really believes in the CHIPS Act because so much is created in Taiwan, and I don't think the normal investor, or even especially the normal consumer, doesn't realize where all of the electronics start, which is on the island of Taiwan that is very close to China. And China would really like to own that outright [and] drive what happens in Taiwan."" The strategist highlights Micron (MU), AMD (AMD), and Synopsys (SNPS) as her top AI picks.

2024-11-08,Nvidia enters the Dow: Why the stock could still double,"The tech stock landscape may look quite different over the next four years with President-elect Donald Trump returning to office. For one, AI regulation of some form will likely have to come from the Trump administration as the fast-moving technology was not clamped down on by the Biden administration. Is that regulation soft or anti-AI innovation? That’s one of the key questions investors will aim to figure out. At the same time, questions will swirl over whether a Trump administration plans to move forward with a breakup of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and possibly, others in big-cap tech. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson. The pair dive into the outlook for market darling Nvidia (NVDA) and AI more broadly in the wake of Donald Trump’s historic White House win. Trump’s win will also likely have ramifications for the Big Tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Tesla (TSLA) that dominate the ""popular Magnificent Seven"" complex.

Ritholtz Wealth Management chief market strategist Callie Cox tells Morning Brief that this change will introduce Nvidia to a broader audience. ""Really, most of America knows the Dow, so a lot of America is gonna be introduced or at least have to get a little bit more familiar with Nvidia and all of what Nvidia means in this AI story,"" she notes. However, Cox points out that the Dow is not a market-cap-weighted index, so Nvidia's inclusion will not have the same significant impact as it would on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) or Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC). ""I really just think it's a brand thing for Nvidia. Nvidia being able to say they're part of one of the most storied indexes on Wall Street, even if that storied index is less powerful these days,"" she states.

S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith to break down what investors need to know and how it will affect the chipmaker's stock and the index itself. ""In order to add Nvidia, obviously, you had to take something out, and Intel was a difficulty,"" Silverblatt tells Yahoo Finance, explaining that because the index is price-weighted, Intel's low price, relative to others in the index, ""did not have a material impact on the index when it was moving, [and] didn't represent the weighting within the index where we wanted to."" ""Nvidia, on the other hand, even though it is less than the average stock ... does better represent the field and has more of an impact on the index,"" he adds. Silverblatt notes that Sherwin Williams (SHW), which was added to the Dow along with Nvidia, ""has a lot more weight than Nvidia"" because the index is price-weighted.

""There's a number of areas where I think Trump is probably going to have an impact [on the chips sector],"" Rasgon tells Yahoo Finance, explaining ""one is certainly tariffs"" and ""one is the CHIPS Act because it does sound like at least the Republicans maybe have a different vision for what that ought to be."" He adds, ""There's a there's a lot of things that he can do beyond just sort of the general volatility around the economy and everything else, both in the US and globally, that is likely to increase under a Trump administration."" On the campaign trail, Trump criticized the Joe Biden administration's CHIPS Act and proposed a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports. The semiconductor industry is ""one of the most global industries,"" the analyst says. On the prospect that the US can completely decouple from China in the chip sector, he says ""I'll hesitate to use the word impossible, but it's very difficult. But clearly, even from the first Trump term, that was where they were trying to go."" He explains, ""The actions that the Biden administration took, I would say, were more surgical. They went after specific things. They went after high-end AI chips. They went after semiconductor equipment for advanced logic and memory, but they weren't really trying to necessarily blow everything up. It was it was manageable. With Trump, he's more like a bull in a china shop."" Rasgon says Trump's 60% tariffs ""would have massive implications both in and out of semis."" He notes that there wouldn't be ""a lot of direct impact for semis on tariffs"" since most of the chips coming into the US from China are in other products like smartphones and PCs. "" It's almost like a secondary kind of thing, if he puts massive tariffs on to make it up on smartphones and PCs, that's going to raise the price of those products in their end markets, and is that going to reduce demand [which,] will certainly roll down to the semiconductors.""

2024-11-11,How a Trump presidency would impact Big Tech,"Following Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election, tech CEOs were quick to send congratulatory messages.

""It's like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump,"" Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of ""hold[ing] a grudge"" or being ""very vindictive."" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they ""stand to gain"" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains ""so uncertain"" given Trump's potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.

2024-11-11,"How Big Tech, AI could fit into Trump's immigration policies","Investors are increasingly optimistic that the technology sector will benefit immensely from Donald Trump's second presidential term. This sentiment is fueled by Trump's pro-crypto stance, the prospect of reduced regulation, and the backing of influential tech CEO Elon Musk. Frontier Foundry Co-Founder and CEO Sultan Meghji joins Catalysts to share his outlook on this emerging trend. ""Even if we just go back to something that looks like a Trump 1.0, and I actually think they'll go farther than that, it'll still be quite a big swing,"" he states, anticipating significant deregulatory measures across the federal bureaucracy that will further energize the AI and crypto markets. Meghji believes that this time around, the Trump administration will view these transformative technologies as ""growth measures for the economy versus things to be managed."" He notes that AI and crypto are ""fundamentally things that should be built and sold out of the United States both for our own use here and globally,"" presenting a ""huge opportunity"" that the president-eleft understands. However, Meghji expresses concern over Trump's mass deportation plans, calling them ""a huge issue."" While acknowledging the desire to attract the ""best and the brightest"" talent, he also points out that immigrants have faced challenges finding open jobs in the US. Ultimately, Meghji says, ""it comes down to what are they actually going to do and how they are going to execute against that,"" suggesting the tech community could play a role in streamlining the immigration process.

2024-11-18,Nvidia must get back to 'double-digit' beats: Portfolio mgr.,"Investors are eagerly awaiting Nvidia's (NVDA) third-quarter results, which will be released on Wednesday, November 20. Independent Solutions Wealth Management portfolio manager Paul Meeks joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on the report. Meeks points out that while Nvidia has continued to outperform expectations each quarter, the earnings beats have been decreasing in recent quarters. ""A lot is expected of Nvidia, and they're gonna have to beat the estimates by even more. Let's get back to a double-digit percentage increase beat, and then I think people will feel more comfortable,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. Despite this, he doesn't see demand slowing at the company, stating, ""Nobody else is as close as they are to making these chips."" Regarding competition, Meeks foresees Nvidia continuing to be a frontrunner in the space. However, he does point to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), believing the company can ""get its act together and be a viable second source."" However, when it comes to overall market share, Meeks states, ""Nvidia will continue to have the biggest slice of that pie.""

""We asked them that question very specifically, what of the policies that the Trump administration has promised, Do you think will be the most beneficial or the most hurtful to your portfolio? Obviously, the ones that would be the most hurtful are the ones you think of tariffs,"" Silver says. ""But when you ask them on the flip side, what about taxes? A lower corporate tax rate, lower income tax breaks, more income tax breaks, obviously that's a positive... but I think investors are caught between this 'we kinda see what this future might look like, but it's still unclear about how that impacts our money' [messaging].""

Wedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson highlights several promising AI-related investments beyond the semiconductor industry. Bryson says that AI includes more than just chips, recommending server manufacturers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Dell Technologies (DELL) as potential investment targets. For networking infrastructure critical to AI development, he spotlights Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options. Nonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: ""It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software — and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in.""

2024-12-04,Tech's Santa Claus rally: Analyst sees AI party carrying into 2025,"A Santa Claus rally is coming for technology stocks, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

The analyst also sees the tech sector gaining by 20% through 2025. ""It's about the multiplier — for every dollar spent on Nvidia chip, there's an $8 to $10 multiplier across tech, across software, infrastructure, cybersecurity. That's why this is going to be a tech bull market that rages into next year,"" Ives explains to Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith. ""Because now it's about the second [or] fourth-derivative. Because now software they're they're on the dance floor at the AI party, they're no longer waiting behind the velvet rope. And now other tech players are trying to get in cybersecurity infrastructure."" Ives also comments on Palantir's (PLTR) position in the so-called AI revolution, speculating that the company has the potential to the next Oracle (ORCL).

2024-12-09,China's Nvidia probe is an escalation in US trade war: Expert,"Nvidia (NVDA) shares are trading lower after news that China has opened an antitrust probe into the artificial intelligence (AI) chip maker. The company is also facing a US antitrust investigation. The Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss his read on the probe and what it means for Nvidia as well as US-China trade relations. ""Nobody should be surprised to hear about an ongoing set of probes against Nvidia, especially coming from China,"" Newman says, explaining there are ""two sides to this one:"" the ""ongoing microaggressions that exist between Chinese and US firms"" and ""China [continuing] to struggle to keep up with the most leading edge advanced AI chip"" so ""they probably want to do what they can to slow US firms down."" The US has limited the export of semiconductors to China to minimize China's access to advanced chips. President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to enforce a 60% tariff on Chinese goods. ""I think what we have here is really more of a macro geopolitical strain than a real problem, but Nvidia is so successful that they're going to get probed by every regulator in the world over the next few years.""

One asset manager weighs in,"Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney joined Market Domination to discuss the potential for a stock split at Netflix (NFLX). Mahoney noted that Netflix is no stranger to stock splits, having previously executed them in February 2004 and July 2015. With Netflix trading above $900, he explained, ""There's a good precedent that once a stock gets over $600... to do a split."" He pointed to Nvidia (NVDA) as a recent example, which completed a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this year and was subsequently added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). The CEO further highlighted that a stock split would attract more investors to Netflix shares. The current price may be ""out of reach for the average investor,"" but a split would open the stock to a broader demographic. Mahoney forecasts that Netflix could potentially opt for a 10-for-1 stock split to increase accessibility.

2024-12-16,Trump & chip sector: Investors need 'supply chain resilience plan',"President-elect Donald Trump has made tariffs a key focus of his second term in the White House, proposing a 60% tariff on all goods from China. The impact of Trump's second term on the semiconductor sector, which has become especially important during the artificial intelligence (AI) era, has been debated, given the impact of tariffs and uncertainty around the CHIPS and Science Act. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead and Tufts University professor of International History Christopher Miller join Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss their outlook for the chip sector under Trump 2.0. Moorhead expects Trump to be a ""net positive"" for the chip sector: ""Trump doesn't want to be the president that tanked the tech stock market, and he certainly could do that if he puts any weight on the chip stocks that have been a tremendous part of the growth over the last four years."" ""With all of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing leaving the United States, or most of it, Trump's trying to get the best deal to bring it back in. I do not believe he will tank the stock market or major industries to make that happen,"" Moorhead notes. Miller — the author of Chip War: The Fight for World's Most Critical Technology — says Trump's chip policy is ""being defined right now by the president-elect and his incoming administration,"" adding that tariffs will likely be a key component of his approach to the semiconductor sector, though there will likely be negotiations between his proposals and the actual policies. Amid uncertainty about Trump's actual policies and their impacts on chipmakers, Moorhead cautions investors saying they ""should be looking into every one of their investment plays and seeing if they have a supply chain resilience plan. It's a what if [plan]."" Watch the video above to learn more about the US-China trade war, the impact of major chipmakers, and more.

2024-12-18,Core Scientific finds a balance in bitcoin mining and AI: CEO,"Some bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners are shifting into artificial intelligence (AI) and selling their existing power to AI data centers as Big Tech companies look for power sources capable of meeting the energy-intensive needs of AI infrastructure. Core Scientific (CORZ) CEO and president Adam Sullivan joins Madison Mills on Catalysts to talk about how the company is balancing its resources to facilitate crypto mining and AI data centers. ""We were the largest bitcoin mining company for the past three years, and that's really driven by the fact that we had to bring in traditional data center people to actually run the business. That's really been our differentiator,"" Sullivan tells Yahoo Finance. The CEO says, ""We think of ourselves as a digital infrastructure company, whether it's building data centers for bitcoin mining or whether it's building data centers to host hundreds of megawatts of [Nvidia's (NVDA)] GB200 that you guys were talking about earlier, you know, our core competency is driven through large-scale digital infrastructure."" Looking to 2025, the company expects ""a relatively equal split"" between crypto mining and AI. Sullivan adds, ""Our expectation is to continue to grow the data center part of the business, which is just a radical shift from the high volatility bitcoin mining space moving into the data center space"" as the ""long-term contracts"" provide ""a lot of long-term and free cash-flow stability that investors really enjoy.""

""Now we are getting into a phase where we need physical build-out of data centers and power associated with them. And the US has gone through a period of time where the power infrastructure has not really been upgraded, both on the grid and the generation side,"" Delevska says about the role energy providers like Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG) will play in powering AI data center infrastructure. ""So as we've brought more renewables to market, the reliability is much lower of the grid. So what we're going to see is power prices spike up in order to incentivize new supply coming to market.""

""Over the past couple of years, I think Big Tech has had significant evidence of success when it comes to artificial intelligence,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. Dessai notes that clear investment value continues to drive growth, benefiting semiconductor leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) and other chip and infrastructure companies. While investment concentration among major companies could eventually slow, Dessai believes this won't happen in 2025. He cites Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip, which promises improved efficiency and necessary computing power. ""AI infrastructure is maturing,"" he explains, predicting that current infrastructure investments will shift toward AI inference as use cases develop by 2030. Although Nvidia maintains market leadership, Dessai identifies Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell (MRVL) as potential market share gainers. ""Our advice to investors would be: If Nvidia has worked for you so far, great, but you need to zoom out and focus on the bigger AI infrastructure and data center landscape and really look to get some exposure to that dynamic,"" he states.

2025-01-06,Why this analyst call himself the 'least bullish' on Nvidia,"Nvidia (NVDA) closed at a record high ahead of CEO Jensen Huang's keynote speech at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). D.A. Davidson head of technology research Gil Luria breaks down the chipmaker's stock moves during the trading day and explains why he considers himself the ""least bullish"" Wall Street analyst covering Nvidia. ""I like to think of myself as maybe the least bullish of the 60-something analysts that cover Nvidia,"" Luria says. ""The reason is that I think this is a cycle just like any other cycle we've ever seen, which is to say: This may be the peak year of the cycle."" The analyst continues, ""For Nvidia stock to be attractive from here, you would need to believe that it can grow 15, 20% into next year and the year after that. We think that that may not happen."" Luria notes that hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are unlikely to continue spending at their current monumental rate and that sovereign artificial intelligence customers are unlikely to make up for any normalization of Big Tech capital spending.

O'Donnell characterizes Nvidia's entry into robotics as ""a long-term play,"" noting that ""it won't happen overnight."" He references Nvidia's early involvement in autonomous vehicles, stating, ""frankly they were a little too early,"" but suggests their head start with such technology means ""now they're coming in much more strongly."" Highlighting Nvidia's ""Cosmos"" release, an artificial intelligence (AI) software platform that ""allows you to do gen AI for physical actions."" In other words, users can train robots, autonomous vehicles, and other devices ""to react and do analog things in the physical world."" He emphasizes its significance, adding, ""That's been a huge stopping point for robotics, and that's why it's a big deal and will have a payoff.""

We have a new administration coming in; we're not certain how that's going to play out."" Despite the uncertainty, Woods clarifies that what's happening now is not unprecedented, noting that ""10% corrections happen, on average, every 18 months"" and the economy is simply in the midst of that cycle. ""I'm not looking to make headlines by saying we're in the midst of a correction,"" Woods says. ""People see that, and they get a little spooked. I think it's a buying opportunity.""

Aurora CEO Chris Urmson explains ""Nvidia provides a really critical part of our system"" — the Aurora Driver system that enables the autonomous vehicles — ""the processor that our algorithms run on."" Nvidia's Drive Thor and DriveOS (operating system) will be integrated into the Aurora Driver system. ""If you're a trucking company today, you're limited to driving that vehicle 11 hours a day because people get tired. With what we're building with the Aurora driver, you should be able to operate that vehicle more like 20 hours a day,"" Urmson further elaborates, adding that this will reduce the dangers of stress and sleep deprivation for long-haul commercial truckers. ""The driver won't get tired. So you can run longer at lower speeds, so you have more fuel economy, which is good for the environment and good for the bottom line. And, of course, while driving a truck is a really important job and we should be thankful for anyone who's willing to do it, there aren't enough people who actually want to do it because it's a tough job.""

2025-03-24,Why Nvidia stock is still a must own,"Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has had a month, as one would say. He provided more details on powerful new AI chips, such as Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin at its big annual GTC conference, chips that could help take civilization to a whole other level of productivity. At the same time, he moved to alter the narrative that DeepSeek's advances in AI equaled bad news for demand for Nvidia's chips. And to top it all off, he held a meeting with top quantum computing CEOs to make peace after sending the sector reeling earlier this year. Despite the flurry of headlines, Nvidia’s stock is still going in reverse. In fact, the stock has been lagging for the entire year. What gives? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with BofA semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya about what’s weighing on Nvidia’s super hot stock, why Arya attended GTC, and shares his firsthand account on what he learned on the ground. Arya is also fresh off upgrading shares of ailing chipmaker Intel (INTC) amid the appointment of a new CEO in Lip-Bu Tan. Sozzi and Arya discuss that big call and the state of the semiconductor industry. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.

There isn’t much Pat Gelsinger hasn’t done in the tech industry. He created cutting-edge technology decades ago at Intel (INTC). Then went off to VMware to reinvent the tech player. He then returned to Intel several years ago to revive the chip giant. But Gelsinger’s tenure at Intel was rocky as the company fell behind rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) with AI chips. The company also made a big decision to start making its own chips, which came at a material cost to the bottom line. With results and the stock price under pressure, Gelsinger and Intel parted ways in December 2024. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with Gelsinger now that he has had some time to reflect on his Intel tenure. Gelsinger has emerged as an investor in startups, taking his experience at Intel and seeking to help the next generation of tech leaders.

2025-05-12,Why US-China tariff agreement isn’t super bullish for stocks,"You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. The bulls are back on Wall Street, with good reason. The US and China have agreed to ratchet down the tariff war for 90 days as each economy begins to feel the pressure of bruising penalties. After a weekend of meetings in Switzerland, the US will take reciprocal tariffs on China down to 10% from 125%. A separate tariff imposed by President Trump over what he says is China’s role in the fentanyl trade will stay intact. China will cut its retaliatory tariffs on US goods to 10% from 125%. Stocks soared on the news, the US dollar caught a strong bid, and defensive plays such as gold sold off. Investors will now be looking for two things to keep the bullish vibes going: first, that the two economic superpowers signal there is an opportunity to take tariffs down even further after the 90-day pause; and second, that the tariffs aren’t hammering the US economy. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi spoke with eToro global markets analyst Lale Akoner on Opening Bid for perspective on whether stocks will be back for the rest of the year or if this is just a headfake. Akoner also discusses top picks in what is now a significantly changed backdrop for investors. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.

2025-05-12,Secrets behind 'Magnificent 7' surge ahead of Nvidia earnings,"You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. The Magnificent 7 stocks are performing strongly again, even with chipmaker Nvidia's earnings report not due until May 28. This leadership group, which had largely underperformed in 2025 due to valuation concerns and macroeconomic risks, has seen a rally since the April 8 lows. This resurgence can be attributed to a couple of key factors. First, tech mega-caps like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL (GOOGL)) significantly exceeded earnings estimates. Barclays' data indicates that these large-cap tech companies beat analyst earnings estimates by an average of 8% in the first quarter. Second, the earnings growth for these major tech players in the first quarter was once again impressive. Goldman Sachs' (GS) data reveals that large-cap tech stocks within the Mag 7 achieved an average earnings growth of 28% in the first quarter, compared to just 9% for the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500.

2025-05-30,Groq’s founder on why AI’s next big shift isn’t about Nvidia,"You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. The race to better compete with AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA) is well underway. Enter Groq (GROQ.PVT). The company makes what it calls language processing units (LPUs). These LPUs are designed to make large language models run faster and more efficiently, unlike Nvidia GPUs that target training models. Groq’s last capital raise was in August 2024, when it raised $640 million from the likes of BlackRock (BLK) and Cisco (CSCO). The company’s valuation at the time stood at $2.8 billion, a fraction of Nvidia’s more than $3 trillion market cap. It currently clocks in at $3.5 billion, according to Yahoo Finance private markets data. At the helm of Groq is founder and CEO Jonathan Ross. While at Google (GOOG), Ross designed the custom chips that the tech giant would go on to train its AI models on. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with Ross to discuss his future plans for Groq. Ross is fresh off a trip with other key tech executives to Saudi Arabia, joining President Donald Trump in forging a deeper tech relationship with the country. Ross begins by sharing with Sozzi the conversations he had on the ground in Saudi Arabia. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.

Wild movements in the bond market have been one of the biggest stories on Wall Street in 2025. In part, the climb in yields on US debt has reflected rising concerns about the country’s fiscal position. Those worries have now been compounded by a new Trump tax bill that promises to add trillions to the US’s already bloated deficit. While professionals say investors haven’t lost trust in the US’s ability to honor its debt, they will continue to demand higher yields to compensate for the rising risk. That could have major ramifications in markets for everything from the demand for Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock to housing. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid podcast with BlackRock (BLK) Global Chief Investment Officer of Fixed Income Rick Rieder, one of the top minds in the bond market. Rieder reveals his latest thinking on fixed income as he manages $2.7 trillion in assets at BlackRock.

But details have been scant since initial news hit the public in early February. Even if a US sovereign wealth fund gets developed, it will have a hard time amassing the size of Norway’s. Norway has the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world with more than $1.8 trillion in investments spanning stocks, fixed income and real estate. It owns close to 9,000 stocks. Looked at another way, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund owns almost 1.5% of all shares in the world’s listed companies. Some well known holdings include Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Google (GOOG), among many others. In charge of managing this fund - which was established in 1990 to diversify from Norway’s oil revenue – is Norges Investment Management CEO Nicolai Tangen. Tangen joined as CEO in September 2020 after a successful run as a top hedge fund manager. He gained another five year term as CEO earlier this year, extending his run atop the fund at least until 2030. Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid podcast with Tangen about how he invests and what’s next for markets. Tangen is also the host of the In Good Company podcast, where he interviews other CEOs usually of companies the fund is invested in. Some headline grabbing interviews have included with Twitter founder and Block (XYZ) CEO Jack Dorsey, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Elliot Management founder Paul Singer.Listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website for full episodes of Opening Bid Unfiltered.

Its shares jumped 4% after the company unveiled plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chip to China, explained Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance.""As we know, Nvidia is the highest-valued stock in the market in the world, north of $4 trillion. So, when Nvidia moves sharply higher, which it is today, that in and of itself can move the Nasdaq. But Oracle, Apple, Microsoft, which are now over 500, those tech stocks are back in control for sure, and that is what's moving the market today.""The news buoyed other chipmakers, with Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer gaining nearly six-and-a-half and seven percent, respectively.Meanwhile, Wall Street banks kicked off second-quarter earnings season, with their stocks whipsawing in volatile trade.Shares of Wells Fargo slid five-and-a-half percent after the bank cut its net interest income forecast, though it beat quarterly profit estimates.JPMorgan Chase raised its 2025 net interest income outlook, but shares still ended lower.BlackRock said its assets under management hit a new high in the second quarter as global markets rallied, but its shares tumbled nearly six percent after it said a large Asian institutional client pulled money from an index strategy.Bucking the trend, Citigroup climbed more than three-and-a-half percent to its highest finish since the global financial crisis, after its traders delivered a windfall that boosted second-quarter profit.Data on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer prices posted their biggest jump in five months in June, hinting that tariffs may be starting to heat up inflation.Still, underlying inflation stayed moderate.Markets are betting the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady this month, with a more than 50% chance the central bank will resume rate cuts in September.",Yahoo

It appears in one eye it's slightly off center, so it doesn't block your view and it disappears after a few seconds when it's not in use so it doesn't distract you.”Huawei has outlined its long-term chip plans for the first time .It's said it will launch some of the world's most powerful computing systems - underscoring China's drive to wean itself off foreign semiconductor suppliers like Nvidia.In an announcement that broke years of secrecy about its chips business, Huawei detailed timelines for its Ascend artificial intelligence chips and Kunpeng server chips.Two Chinese companies — WeRide and Pony.ai — say they will partner with local firms to launch robotaxi services in Singapore.The city-state is expanding into autonomous driving.Ride-hailing operator Grab said it would also partner with WeRide to begin services next year.Brazil's Embraer could get certification of its electric aircraft in 2027.Although the new president of the country's aviation regulator told Reuters he would like to hit that milestone a year earlier.Embraer's subsidiary Eve is among several firms developing battery-powered aircraft that can take off and land vertically to ferry travellers on short city trips.",Yahoo
