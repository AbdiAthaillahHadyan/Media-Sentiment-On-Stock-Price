2024-10-03,"Jobless claims data, market volatility, China stocks: Morning Brief","On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze the market and report on some of the biggest stories of the trading day. All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened lower on Thursday amid the latest labor market data and increasing Middle East tensions. Initial jobless claims for the week ending September 28 rose to 225,000, slightly above the estimated 221,000. Oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) are continuing to spike as tensions boil between Israel and Iran. US stock markets are experiencing a period of heightened volatility, driven by a variety of factors including Hurricane Helene, the upcoming US presidential election, and escalating Middle East tensions. The Wealth Consulting Group's chief market strategist Talley Léger acknowledges that markets have been hit by numerous events that could potentially unsettle investors, questioning, ""when are they perfectly certain?"" However, he notes that such turbulence is a common occurrence in financial markets, adding that ""through it all, the stock market has continued its inexorable march forward."" Due to this dynamic, Léger advises investors to view market dips as potential buying opportunities. The rotation out of Big Tech has become evident, with the standout ""Magnificent Seven"" (AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, GOOGL, AMZN, META, MSFT, NVDA) names no longer being the market frontrunners they once were. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza notes that the Magnificent Seven's market leadership ""hit an abrupt stop"" in mid-July, fueled by the unwinding of the yen carry trade. While Meta has been the only name to somewhat recover, Mazza believes ""it's too early to give up"" on the Magnificent Seven. Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt’s senior research analyst, outlines his bullish stance on Meta. “The growth supports the multiple… The bigger backdrop, we think, is that people are getting more comfortable with Meta’s strategic positioning. Their investments in AI have yielded improved returns on investment for marketers and better engagement from users, and they've kind of led and developed this direct marketing to kind of small- or mid-sized companies globally. This almost new niche that they've pioneered and owned.” Crockett explains. The Hang Seng (^HSI) ended the day lower after 13 straight days of gains following a wave of stimulus measures aimed at bolstering the country's struggling economy. While JPMorgan has warned investors about the risks of chasing the rally given its high valuations, KraneShares CIO Brendan Ahern argues it's still in the ""very, very early innings."" With more information about fiscal policy expected from Chinese officials, the rally could continue. He adds, ""Instead of looking through the rearview mirror, let's look through the windshield.""

Goldman Sachs Director of Americas Equity Research Steve Kron joins Catalysts to discuss the details. Kron explains that the purpose of this list is to help investors identify stocks where Goldman Sachs has ""the highest level of conviction"" for outperformance. Since the list's introduction last June, Kron emphasizes that ""the feedback has been fantastic."" Pinterest (PINS) was recently added to the list, while Amazon (AMZN) and Guidewire (GWRE) were removed. According to Kron, Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan believes Pinterest has the ability to ""monetize their user base,"" with margin expansion potential over the next five years and earnings projected to be 6% above estimates in 2025. The stock also presents a favorable 3-to-1 upside-to-downside risk ratio. As for Amazon and Guidewire, they were removed to ""keep the list fresh,"" though Kron notes they remain solid stock picks. Regarding the selection process, Kron tells Yahoo Finance, ""We spend a lot of time on investment process, and we spend a lot of time with our analysts talking about stock recommendations. So these are sourced from them,"" with names like Nvidia (NVDA) and Citigroup (C) both making the list.

2024-10-14,How to separate earnings winners from losers: Asset manager,"Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney joins Wealth! Host Brad Smith to break down his earnings season dos and don'ts as well as take a look at his artificial intelligence (AI) picks, including Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Walmart (WMT), during third quarter results. “Jumping in front of earnings, that's a no-no,” Mahoney says, adding, “That's like Russian roulette again.” He outlines, “What we like to do in our kind of playbook, as you said, is actually find those companies that beat estimates, raise guidance, and then the analysts trip over themselves.” Conversely, “stay away from the other ones,” Mahoney says, explaining that when a company reports an earnings miss and the stock takes a nosedive, “It looks cheap, [but] I'm telling your viewers that's quicksand. You’d rather go with those companies that beat and raise guidance, even if you have to pay up for it.” Mahoney says he's looking for companies he wants to buy again. “They're going to appear to be kind of expensive. They may take out the year high, but behind it is momentum. Behind it is still those analysts [who] are still playing catch up. So, to us, it separates the men from the boys, so to speak. We'll see that this earnings season as we'll see every other earnings season.” As far as specific names, Mahoney says, “We like technology because they're more consistent.” With consideration to his earnings framework and the ongoing AI trade, he says “We love Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple. All those names kind of and most of those names are going to beat raise guidance probably buy back stock” as well as “companies like Walmart who are actually using [AI] data” to boost productivity.

""The gap in terms of timing between what Nvidia is delivering, what AMD is delivering is still very, very wide. I think it's still Nvidia's game to lose,"" Rasgon says.

2024-10-26,Nvidia earnings: What to expect from the market's AI darling,"Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report third quarter earnings for the fiscal 2025 on Wednesday, November 20. Goldman Sachs managing director Toshiya Hari joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss what to expect from the key artificial intelligence (AI) player. The analyst highlights two things that he’s keeping in mind heading into the earnings results: the demand environment around Nvidia’s products and Nvidia’s strength beyond AI training in inferencing that support the chipmaker's growth is strong and sustainable. “First, in terms of the demand profile out there, the environment continues to be very robust. If there is a problem, it's a supply problem, not a demand problem.” Hari notes that while hyperscalers like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) have been Nvidia’s biggest AI customers as they build out AI infrastructure, “the customer profile is broadening beyond the hyperscalers into enterprises and also sovereign states. So there is demand across the board there.” “Secondly, I think there's been this perception historically that Nvidia is very strong in training, yet their competitive position could potentially dilute as we transition to inference… [However] Nvidia's growth opportunity set and potentially expand the competitive moat that they have."" The analyst says that Nvidia's ability ""to really innovate across multiple components” at ""a 12- [to] 18-month cadence” has set it apart from others in the AI space and secured its dominant position. “I think it's going to be very difficult, very challenging, and expensive for others to compete head-to-head with Nvidia.” While the market seems bullish on Nvidia in the near future, Hari says “the big question mark” is the outlook for the 2026 calendar year as investors try to gauge if hyperscalers will continue to spend billions on Nvidia’s chips. Despite Nvidia recently setting a fresh record high, Hari is among analysts who think the stock has more to run. “We do expect upside from here” ahead of Nvidia's report as hyperscalers announce earnings that could send the stock higher.

2024-11-08,Dow entry is 'a brand thing' for Nvidia: Strategist,"Nvidia (NVDA) is set to replace Intel (INTC) on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) on Friday. Intel has been a fixture in the benchmark index since 1999, but its shares have plummeted nearly 48% throughout 2024. Ritholtz Wealth Management chief market strategist Callie Cox tells Morning Brief that this change will introduce Nvidia to a broader audience. ""Really, most of America knows the Dow, so a lot of America is gonna be introduced or at least have to get a little bit more familiar with Nvidia and all of what Nvidia means in this AI story,"" she notes. However, Cox points out that the Dow is not a market-cap-weighted index, so Nvidia's inclusion will not have the same significant impact as it would on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) or Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC). ""I really just think it's a brand thing for Nvidia. Nvidia being able to say they're part of one of the most storied indexes on Wall Street, even if that storied index is less powerful these days,"" she states.

2024-11-08,Why Nvidia is replacing Intel in the Dow: What you need to know,"Nvidia (NVDA) will replace Intel (INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index (^DJI). S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith to break down what investors need to know and how it will affect the chipmaker's stock and the index itself. ""In order to add Nvidia, obviously, you had to take something out, and Intel was a difficulty,"" Silverblatt tells Yahoo Finance, explaining that because the index is price-weighted, Intel's low price, relative to others in the index, ""did not have a material impact on the index when it was moving, [and] didn't represent the weighting within the index where we wanted to."" ""Nvidia, on the other hand, even though it is less than the average stock ... does better represent the field and has more of an impact on the index,"" he adds. Silverblatt notes that Sherwin Williams (SHW), which was added to the Dow along with Nvidia, ""has a lot more weight than Nvidia"" because the index is price-weighted.

2024-11-08,"It's 'very, very difficult' to decouple US from China on chips","As investors assess the impact of former President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on China after he secured reelection, Bernstein managing director and senior analyst Stacy Rasgon joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss where a second Trump term leaves the semiconductor industry and top chipmakers, like Nvidia (NVDA). ""There's a number of areas where I think Trump is probably going to have an impact [on the chips sector],"" Rasgon tells Yahoo Finance, explaining ""one is certainly tariffs"" and ""one is the CHIPS Act because it does sound like at least the Republicans maybe have a different vision for what that ought to be."" He adds, ""There's a there's a lot of things that he can do beyond just sort of the general volatility around the economy and everything else, both in the US and globally, that is likely to increase under a Trump administration."" On the campaign trail, Trump criticized the Joe Biden administration's CHIPS Act and proposed a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports. The semiconductor industry is ""one of the most global industries,"" the analyst says. On the prospect that the US can completely decouple from China in the chip sector, he says ""I'll hesitate to use the word impossible, but it's very difficult. But clearly, even from the first Trump term, that was where they were trying to go."" He explains, ""The actions that the Biden administration took, I would say, were more surgical. They went after specific things. They went after high-end AI chips. They went after semiconductor equipment for advanced logic and memory, but they weren't really trying to necessarily blow everything up. It was it was manageable. With Trump, he's more like a bull in a china shop."" Rasgon says Trump's 60% tariffs ""would have massive implications both in and out of semis."" He notes that there wouldn't be ""a lot of direct impact for semis on tariffs"" since most of the chips coming into the US from China are in other products like smartphones and PCs. "" It's almost like a secondary kind of thing, if he puts massive tariffs on to make it up on smartphones and PCs, that's going to raise the price of those products in their end markets, and is that going to reduce demand [which,] will certainly roll down to the semiconductors.""

While the stock is currently under scrutiny as the only Magnificent Seven stock declining since November 1, Woods maintains that Nvidia remains fundamentally strong.

""The move is just a garden variety sell-off, but the amount of stocks that are down is a little head-scratching,"" he states.

The CEO says, ""We think of ourselves as a digital infrastructure company, whether it's building data centers for bitcoin mining or whether it's building data centers to host hundreds of megawatts of [Nvidia's (NVDA)] GB200 that you guys were talking about earlier, you know, our core competency is driven through large-scale digital infrastructure.""

2025-01-06,Why this analyst call himself the 'least bullish' on Nvidia,"Nvidia (NVDA) closed at a record high ahead of CEO Jensen Huang's keynote speech at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). D.A. Davidson head of technology research Gil Luria breaks down the chipmaker's stock moves during the trading day and explains why he considers himself the ""least bullish"" Wall Street analyst covering Nvidia. ""I like to think of myself as maybe the least bullish of the 60-something analysts that cover Nvidia,"" Luria says. ""The reason is that I think this is a cycle just like any other cycle we've ever seen, which is to say: This may be the peak year of the cycle."" The analyst continues, ""For Nvidia stock to be attractive from here, you would need to believe that it can grow 15, 20% into next year and the year after that. We think that that may not happen."" Luria notes that hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are unlikely to continue spending at their current monumental rate and that sovereign artificial intelligence customers are unlikely to make up for any normalization of Big Tech capital spending.

Aurora CEO Chris Urmson explains ""Nvidia provides a really critical part of our system"" — the Aurora Driver system that enables the autonomous vehicles — ""the processor that our algorithms run on."" Nvidia's Drive Thor and DriveOS (operating system) will be integrated into the Aurora Driver system. ""If you're a trucking company today, you're limited to driving that vehicle 11 hours a day because people get tired. With what we're building with the Aurora driver, you should be able to operate that vehicle more like 20 hours a day,"" Urmson further elaborates, adding that this will reduce the dangers of stress and sleep deprivation for long-haul commercial truckers. ""The driver won't get tired. So you can run longer at lower speeds, so you have more fuel economy, which is good for the environment and good for the bottom line. And, of course, while driving a truck is a really important job and we should be thankful for anyone who's willing to do it, there aren't enough people who actually want to do it because it's a tough job.""

The race to better compete with AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA) is well underway. Enter Groq (GROQ.PVT). The company makes what it calls language processing units (LPUs). These LPUs are designed to make large language models run faster and more efficiently, unlike Nvidia GPUs that target training models. Groq’s last capital raise was in August 2024, when it raised $640 million from the likes of BlackRock (BLK) and Cisco (CSCO). The company’s valuation at the time stood at $2.8 billion, a fraction of Nvidia’s more than $3 trillion market cap. It currently clocks in at $3.5 billion, according to Yahoo Finance private markets data. At the helm of Groq is founder and CEO Jonathan Ross.

Those worries have now been compounded by a new Trump tax bill that promises to add trillions to the US’s already bloated deficit. While professionals say investors haven’t lost trust in the US’s ability to honor its debt, they will continue to demand higher yields to compensate for the rising risk. That could have major ramifications in markets for everything from the demand for Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock to housing.

Tangen joined as CEO in September 2020 after a successful run as a top hedge fund manager. He gained another five year term as CEO earlier this year, extending his run atop the fund at least until 2030.
