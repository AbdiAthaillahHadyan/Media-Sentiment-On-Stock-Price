But in the long term, if this idea of a store of value and the US dollar always being devalued, I think bitcoin goes higher and higher.""

2024-12-11,GameStop earnings: Stocktwits exec's retrospective on retail trading,"Video game retailer GameStop (GME) is popping on in after-hours trading after releasing third quarter earnings, posting net sales of $860.3 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.06. GameStop and fellow meme stock AMC Entertainment (AMC) got a momentary stock boost last week after retail trader Keith Gill — known as ""Roaring Kitty"" on social media — made a post on X. Stocktwits head of market research Tom Bruni sits down with Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to speak more on GameStop's quarterly performance, the current state of the meme stock trade, and the Stocktwits platform itself. ""Thinking back to 2021, a lot of people thought this was just a phase. And that is not the case. Retail has stuck around — we're seeing record levels of options activity, record trading activity, we've got Robinhood (HOOD) adding betting markets,"" Bruni says. ""So kind of like this degenerate economy of betting on everything including stocks is kind of taking hold here. And so I think Wall Street has identified this as something that's not going away. And so they're trying to figure out how to navigate it.""  Bruni also weighs in on bitcoin (BTC-USD) and the enthusiasm behind crypto trading and investments into spot crypto ETFs, attributing it to the new ""democratization of those kind of non-traditional assets via traditional vehicles"" on brokerage platforms.

2025-03-28,Is GameStop the next Forever 21? Or MicroStrategy? Or Robinhood?,"No surprise here, GameStop (GME) produced another dreadful year of results in 2024. The gaming retailer reported sales last year crashed 27%. Adjusted operating profits tanked 94%. Sales fell by double-digits in every region GameStop operates, most importantly its largest market the US – sales declined 24.9%. The culprit? Persistent weakness in the gaming software industry as people are back in offices working and games can run more than $60 a pop. But the awful year for GameStop isn’t the headline maker for the company’s latest earnings release day. Nope, it’s the company saying it will now have an investment committee led by controversial chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen that will aim to invest in bitcoin (BTC-USD). The company has $4.775 billion in cash and thousands of store leases coming up for renewal, so it has the funds to dabble in such a bitcoin pivot. The question is this: should GameStop be considered a struggling retailer anymore? Or something else in the mold of Michael Saylor’s bitcoin buying former software play MicroStrategy (MSTR), now known as Strategy? Will Cohen turn it into a crypto trading platform like Robinhood (HOOD) and Coinbase (COIN)? Is he trying to follow Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) by taking a failed operation and building around it a highly lucrative investment portfolio? Who knows!
